        <h1>My Baby Aila,</h1>
        <p>As Valentine's Day approaches, I want to express my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding earlier. I understand the frustration caused by my silence, but please know that I've been meticulously planning something special for us. I wanted it to be a surprise, something that would truly make this day memorable for both of us.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry for what happened earlier. I know that I have a plan for the upcoming Valentine's Day, but I haven't told you because I want it to be special and a secret. But since you mentioned it, I don't have a choice but to reveal it. Can you be my Valentine's date? I'm sorry for what happened earlier, and I'm sorry if you were hoping for something else, but I assure you I had a plan. I hope you won't replace me and I hope you won't look for someone else. I love youuu. One last time,</p>
        <p>Can you be my Valentine's date baby, asawa, wife?</p>
        <div class="invitation">
            <p>This Valentine's Day, I want to make it up to you and spend it in the most special way possible. I hope you'll forgive me and join me for a romantic evening filled with love, laughter, and cherished moments.</p>
            <p>With all my love and sincerest apologies,</p>
            <p>Cyrus</p>
